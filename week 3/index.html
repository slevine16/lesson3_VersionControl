            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a method of editing, storing and sharing projects. There are many benefits of this system for developers. It is more effective, as it allows numerous users to work on a single file. The developers can check in and out files from one main repository. Additionally, version control tracks who made changes and what they changed. This system will automatically backup files and allows the developers to revert back to a prior one if necessary. Files can also not be overwritten and the main repository will hold all of the latest files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository stores metadata for a set of files or data structure in a version control system. There are two kinds of repositories: remote and local. Information is either copied onto every developer’s system or can be maintained on a single remote server, local and remote respectively. The information stored can include: a history of changes, a set of commit objects and a set of references to commit objects. Version control systems and repositories handle how they store these changes differently, which has led to varying types of use. One can create a local repository by starting a brand new one or by cloning an existing remote repository onto a local machine. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is described as “a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency” in the reading. Its many advantages put Git in front of SCM tools such as, Subversion, CVS, Perforce and ClearCase. Git is simple to grasp and understand. It also has a fast performance rate. Boasting cheap local branding, convenient staging areas and multiple workflows. The processes are faster and there is no single point of failure. A full copy of the repository data is stored locally on each developer’s screen. Finally, Git does not allow files to be overwritten on the shared repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three basic Git commands: add, commit and push. To create a new local repository one must use $ git init. To view all of the new or modified files to be committed the command is $ git status. $ git commit -m “[descriptive message]” will record file snapshots permanently in version history. $ git push will upload all local branch commits to the remote repository. To initializes a new Git repository the command is git init. Until you run this command inside a repository or directory, it's just a regular folder. Only after you input this does it accept further Git commands. If one forgets a command, one can use git help.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A README file contains important information about the software. It is a short document and distributed with the software. The developer usually writes it in plain text. A README file serves to share information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. It is written using markdowns, which are simple and effective syntax used for styling on Github. Many different pieces of information may be included such as: configuration, installation and operating instructions, copyright and licensing information, known bugs, troubleshooting, and credits and acknowledgements. This has become a convention and is now a requirement by the GNU Coding Standards.</p>
